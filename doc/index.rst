SERAPH L432KC by Materiam
################

Overview
********

The Seraph L432KC is a breakout board for the little but mighty STM32L432KC
ultra low power Cortex M4 MCU. With its three bright RGB leds and user/BOOT0
button, it's been especially designed for learning Zephyr and to be easily
integrated into your projects.

The STM32L432KC shines for its low power consumption, so we chose to power it
with an STLQ020 ultra-low quiescent current LDO power supply that can source up
to 200 mA and consumes a mere 100Î¼A at a 200mA load and only 300 nA at no load!

The USB data lines are ESD protected through the USBLC6-2SC6 from ST. The Vin
voltage input is reverse polarity protected and there is also a 500 mA
resettable fuse to protect the USB/VIN power source from overcurrents.

Last but not least, We have included big, high quality and confortable
buttons for BOOT (white) and RESET (black) functions that go easy on your
fingers and lets you put the SERAPH board on DFU mode quickly without the need
of jumpers or connecting-disconnecting the USB cable.

The STM32 built-in DFU bootloader lets the user program the device without
an external hardware programmer while saving valuable flash memory for user
applications. Not a single kb is wasted on the integrated bootloader. Just press
the user button (BOOT0) while holding RESET in a fast and simple finger movement
and the green led will light indicating DFU mode.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nucleo_l432kc`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Nucleo L432KC board includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool
interface.  This interface is supported by the openocd version
included in the Zephyr SDK since v0.9.2.

Flashing an application to Nucleo L432KC
----------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo L432KC to your host computer using the USB port,
then run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Now build and flash an application. Here is an example for
:ref:`hello_world`.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_l432kc
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   $ Hello World! arm


Debugging
